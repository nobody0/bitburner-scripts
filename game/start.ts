/** Single entry point for both boot situations (autoexec: `start.js main`):
 *  - COLD: the game just loaded. The JS realm is fresh (gameGlobal empty) and
 *    with "Exclude Running Scripts from Save" nothing else survived — full
 *    sweep: scan, root, redeploy the whole fleet.
 *    Source: https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/3162fd2590e221eadd0c0fbd46151913f7c4c41c/src/Server/BaseServer.ts#L296-L311
 *  - HANDOFF: a newer build was pushed; the previous instance exec'd us with
 *    ("handoff", buildId) and exited. The realm and the remote starters
 *    survive — inherit the game-state store and keep farming.
 *    Source (scripts are imported modules in the page realm): https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/3162fd2590e221eadd0c0fbd46151913f7c4c41c/src/NetscriptJSEvaluator.ts#L208-L223
 *  Either way the controller-epoch guard makes the newest instance the only
 *  controller: an older loop sees the bumped epoch and exits — no kills.
 *
 * This file is the startup script and nothing else; the loop lives in
 * lib/controller.ts. Both land in one bundle, so the split costs no RAM.
 *
 * Fresh-game RAM budget (8 GB home): start.js 3.6 GB static + transient
 * dodge stub <= 4.1 GB = 7.7 GB peak; handoff overlap 2 x 3.6 = 7.2 GB. Fits.
